Hey! My name is **Jayden**. I'm a full stack developer most proficient in Node.js, JS/TS, React, and related tech. I usually weave my enjoyment of programming with my other hobby: gaming. If you're a content creator, you can find some of my work in the [Aitum](https://aitum.tv) software - I recommend checking it out!

Since 2018, I've been one of the system administrators for the official [RuneScape and OSRS Wikis](https://runescape.wiki) (@weirdgloop), and I also develop MediaWiki extensions and customised forks of existing projects for use across those wikis.
